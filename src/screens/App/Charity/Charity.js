              Here at winners wish charity is entwined with everything that we
              do. That is why we donate 5% of each competition entry sold to
              charity. And you decide where that money goes by selecting one of
              our charity partners in our members area, and change your cause
              any time you like. By going this, winners wish and our members
              work together to give back and support charitable organisations.
              Check out our charity page to see the organisations we support and
              the latest donation updates. Below are the charitable
              organisations that we work with.
